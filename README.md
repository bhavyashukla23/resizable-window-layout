# Resizable React WIndows Layout

This project demonstrates how to create a layout with resizable panels using React and the react-resizable-panels package. The layout consists of three different components arranged in a grid-like structure. Users can resize the components by dragging them from any side, and the neighboring components will expand or shrink accordingly.
